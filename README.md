### M-Bus Wireless/LoRaWAN decoder

This repository is a part of Engineer's thesis.

Modern measuring devices, used in households to measure media consumption, use the wireless M-Bus Wireless transmission technology, which allows remote reading of their state. This way of reading the data from the meters is a great ease for operators, who previously had to hire employees responsible for visiting each customer, in order to write down the status of the meter. Currently, it is sufficient for an employee equipped with a radio receiver to approach the distance required to receive transmission from the measuring devices. Unfortunately, the maximum distance for receiving the transmission is small and does not allow full remote reading. In this work, the proposed solution is to create an embedded system allowing for the collection of readings from the measuring devices located in the area, and then processing them and sending to the operator using the LoRaWAN protocol, which is characterized by a much larger transmission range, up to several kilometers.
